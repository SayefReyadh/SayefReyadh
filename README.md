### _WHOAMI_

Hello again, you can call me Sayef, a serverless superhero with a passion for developing backend solutions that are efficient, scalable, and reliable. You could call me the Backend Batman, or maybe the AWS Avenger, either way, I'm here to save the day!

With over 3+ years of professional experience. I specialize in serverless backend development using Typescript, Python, and all things AWS Serverless Compute Services (Lambda, Fargate, etc.) might have to offer. While I can whip up a React 18 web app and style it with Tailwind CSS, I prefer to focus on what really gets my gears turning, optimizing system performance to make everything run like a well-oiled machine.

I'm always on the lookout for the latest and greatest in technology and best practices, so you can count on me to stay up to date on all the serverless trends. When I'm not developing world-class backend solutions, you can find me writing technical blogs or contributing to open-source projects like sharp, serverless/examples, and nvm-windows. And, if that's not enough, I even create tutorials in Bangla at Sayef Reyadh - Programming Made Simple, because sharing is caring.

In my past life, I was a Lecturer at Daffodil International University, teaching the next generation of computer science and engineering students about data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. I learned the importance of understanding, empathizing, and having patience with my audience, a skill that has helped me create better workflows for customers/users in my current roles.

But now, I'm here at Craftsmen, ready to take on any challenge that comes my way. So, if you're looking for a serverless superhero to join your team, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm ready to save the day, one efficient, scalable, and reliable backend solution at a time!
